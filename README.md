# Description

The Automated Remarkable Assistant

A project I started recently which works as an AI virtual assistant using Python (in the future of the development similar to Iron Man's J.A.R.V.I.S. or F.R.I.D.A.Y.)  
Requirements for libraries (for now):  
- pyttsx3
- datetime
- speech_recognition as sr
- wikipedia
- wolframalpha
- webbrowser
- ctypes
- psutil
- pyautogui
- os
- sys
- subprocess
- random
